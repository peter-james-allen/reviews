# External Code Reviews

These reviews provided written feedback on my coding process and how I tackle programming problems. Each review was an hour-long session in which the reviewer roleplayed as a product owner with a set of non-technical requirements. I then converted these requirements into working, tested, code while the reviewer assessed me.
